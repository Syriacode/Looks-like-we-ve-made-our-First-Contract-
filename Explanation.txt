Level One is an AssociateProfitSplitter contract. This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

Level Two is a TieredProfitSplitter that will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.
Profit is split unevenly with 65% going to the first employee, 25% going to the second, and 15% going to the third.


Level Three is a DeferredEquityPlan that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
Traditional company stock plan that manages the distribution of 1,000 shares over 4 years. Since the stock distribution plan is deferred, employees' accounts will be locked for the first year.
